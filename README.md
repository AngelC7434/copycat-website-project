Reflection: I chose to do a copycat website based on PupilPath’s home page because i think it best suits my level and understanding of css and html currently. I’m not that confident in creating anything at a higher level yet so I think starting from the basics ones is a good idea. Some concepts used on the page are from what we learned and taught each other in the team coding project/presentation. From this project I didn’t learn much from the actual coding, but from how I found a way to code. I realized that learning how to us outside resources can sometimes can be one of the most important part of creating a project. There are useful websites that I could go to, and classmates that I can go to for help.
